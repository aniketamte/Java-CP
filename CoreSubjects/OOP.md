Absolutely, Aniket. Let’s begin your **complete OOP in Java journey**, step by step, with **detailed, easy-to-understand explanations, code, and real-world comparisons** — without skipping anything.

---

# ✅ 1. **Class and Object in Java** (💯 Full Explanation)

---

## 🔷 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Before we understand classes and objects, let's understand OOP.

### 🔹 OOP is a programming style based on **real-world entities** like:

* Person, Car, Bank Account, Animal, etc.

OOP makes your code:

* **Modular** (easy to divide into pieces)
* **Reusable** (write once, use many times)
* **Secure** (through abstraction & encapsulation)
* **Maintainable** (easy to update and debug)

---

## 🔷 What is a Class?

* A **class** is like a **blueprint**, **template**, or **plan**.
* It defines the structure (data) and behavior (functions) of real-world entities.

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

> Think of a **class** like a **blueprint of a house**. It defines how a house should look — walls, rooms, windows, etc. But it’s **not** a house itself.
>
> To build a house, you must **create an object** from the blueprint.

---

### ✅ Java Class Syntax:

```java
class ClassName {
    // Fields (variables or attributes)
    // Methods (functions or behaviors)
}
```

---

### ✅ Example 1: Define a class `Car`

```java
// Define the class
class Car {
    // Fields / Attributes
    String color;
    int speed;

    // Method / Behavior
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving.");
    }

    void stop() {
        System.out.println("The car has stopped.");
    }
}
```

At this point, **no car exists**. We have only written a plan for what a Car looks like and what it can do.

---

## 🔷 What is an Object?

* An **object** is a **real instance** of a class.
* It occupies **memory** and can be used to call class methods or access fields.

### ✅ Java  Object Syntax:

```java
ClassName objName = new ClassName();
```

### ✅ Example 2: Create and use a `Car` object

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();      // Create an object of Car
        myCar.color = "Red";        // Set attributes
        myCar.speed = 120;

        System.out.println("Car color: " + myCar.color);
        System.out.println("Car speed: " + myCar.speed + " km/h");

        myCar.drive();              // Call method
        myCar.stop();               // Call method
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Car color: Red
Car speed: 120 km/h
The car is driving.
The car has stopped.
```

---

## 🔷 Constructor in Java

### ✅ What is a Constructor?

* A **constructor** is a **special method** with the same name as the class.
* It is **automatically called** when an object is created.
* Its main purpose is to **initialize the object**.

### ✅ Rules of Constructors:

* Name must be the same as the class
* No return type (not even `void`)
* Can be **default** or **parameterized**

---

### ✅ 1. Default Constructor:

If you don’t define any constructor, Java provides one automatically.

```java
class Bike {
    Bike() {
        System.out.println("Bike is created");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bike myBike = new Bike();  // Constructor is automatically called
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Bike is created
```

---

### ✅ 2. Parameterized Constructor:

Used to initialize values when the object is created.

```java
class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor with parameters
    Student(String n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }

    void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student("Aniket", 21);  // Values passed
        s1.showDetails();
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Name: Aniket
Age: 21
```

---

## 🔷 `this` Keyword in Java

### ✅ Why do we need `this`?

* When the **constructor parameters have the same name** as the class variables, we use `this` to refer to the **current object's variable**.

### ✅ Example Without `this` (Confusing 👎)

```java
class Employee {
    String name;

    Employee(String name) {
        name = name;   // Which name? Confusing!
    }

    void show() {
        System.out.println(name);  // Output: null
    }
}
```

Here, the parameter `name` shadows the instance variable `name`, so `name = name` does nothing useful.

---

### ✅ Example With `this` (Correct 👍)

```java
class Employee {
    String name;

    Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;  // this.name refers to instance variable
    }

    void show() {
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("Aniket");
        e1.show();   // Output: Aniket
    }
}
```

---

## 🔷 Summary:

| Concept                       | Meaning                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class**                     | Blueprint that defines variables and methods                        |
| **Object**                    | Real instance of a class; created using `new` keyword               |
| **Constructor**               | Special method to initialize objects, called when object is created |
| **Default Constructor**       | Constructor without parameters (provided by Java if not defined)    |
| **Parameterized Constructor** | Constructor with parameters for initialization                      |
| **this keyword**              | Refers to the current object’s instance variable                    |

---

## ✅ Practice Task 1 (Highly Recommended 🚀):

Create a Java program with:

* Class: `Book`
* Fields: `title`, `author`, `price`
* Constructor: parameterized
* Method: `displayDetails()` to print all values
* In `main()` method: create 2 `Book` objects and display their details.

---

Perfect, Aniket. Let’s continue directly and go deep into the **second pillar of OOP in Java: Encapsulation** — with full explanation, examples, and real-world connection.

---

# ✅ 2. **Encapsulation in Java** (💯 Full Detail)

---

## 🔷 What is Encapsulation?

> **Encapsulation** is the process of **wrapping data (variables)** and **code (methods)** together into a **single unit** (class) and **restricting direct access** to some of the object's components.

---

### 🔑 Key Points:

* It hides internal data from outside classes.
* You **control** how data is accessed or modified using **getter and setter methods**.
* Makes your code **secure**, **flexible**, and **easy to maintain**.

---

## 🔐 Real-World Analogy:

Think of a **capsule** – it contains **medicine** inside, and you can only consume it through a **proper method** (swallowing it, not opening it and touching it directly).

Similarly:

* The **class** is the capsule.
* The **variables are protected inside**.
* We access them using **methods** like `get()` and `set()`.

---

## 💡 Why is Encapsulation Needed?

1. ✅ To protect data from accidental modification
2. ✅ To hide the complexity of internal logic
3. ✅ To control what the user can and cannot do
4. ✅ To make your code modular and manageable

---

## 🧱 How to Implement Encapsulation in Java?

### ✅ 4 Key Rules:

| Rule | Explanation                                    |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | Declare variables as `private`                 |
| 2.   | Provide `public` getter methods to read data   |
| 3.   | Provide `public` setter methods to update data |
| 4.   | Wrap all this inside a class                   |

---

### ✅ Example: Student Class with Encapsulation

```java
class Student {
    // Step 1: Private fields
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Step 2: Public setter method to set name
    public void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }

    // Step 3: Public getter method to get name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for age
    public void setAge(int newAge) {
        if (newAge > 0) {
            age = newAge;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age must be positive.");
        }
    }

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Using Encapsulated Class

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();

        s1.setName("Aniket");
        s1.setAge(21);

        System.out.println("Student Name: " + s1.getName());
        System.out.println("Student Age: " + s1.getAge());
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Student Name: Aniket
Student Age: 21
```

---

## 🚫 What if we break encapsulation?

```java
class Student {
    public String name;   // Not private
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.name = "Aniket";     // Direct access

        System.out.println(s.name);
    }
}
```

> 🔴 This is **not safe**. Anyone can directly modify `name` without restrictions, leading to **security issues or invalid data**.

---

## 📌 Advantages of Encapsulation

| Advantage           | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Data hiding       | Variables are not directly accessible                |
| ✅ Increased control | Control over how data is modified                    |
| ✅ Flexibility       | Logic can be changed without affecting other classes |
| ✅ Reusability       | Easy to use in other programs                        |
| ✅ Security          | Prevents misuse of sensitive data                    |

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Term              | Meaning                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encapsulation** | Hiding data inside class using private access and accessing via public methods |
| **Getter**        | A method that **returns** the value of a private field                         |
| **Setter**        | A method that **sets/updates** the value of a private field                    |
| **private**       | Access modifier to restrict access only within the class                       |

---

## ✅ Practice Task 2:

Create a class `BankAccount`:

* Private fields: `accountNumber`, `balance`
* Methods:

  * `setAccountNumber()`, `getAccountNumber()`
  * `setBalance()`, `getBalance()`
* In `main()`, create an object and set values using methods, then display them.

---

You're absolutely right, Aniket. Thanks for your patience — from now on, I will **go ahead one by one**, fully detailed, without asking for confirmation. Let's continue with the **next core concept** of OOP in Java:

---

# ✅ 3. **Inheritance in Java** (💯 Full Detail)

---

## 🔷 What is Inheritance?

> Inheritance is a mechanism in Java by which **one class (child/subclass)** is allowed to **inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods)** of **another class (parent/superclass)**.

---

## 🔑 Key Points:

* Promotes **code reusability** — write once, use many times.
* Supports **hierarchical classifications** — like "Dog is an Animal".
* Enables **method overriding** and **polymorphism**.

---

## 🔐 Real-World Analogy:

Think of **inheritance in a family**:

* A **child** inherits properties like surname, traits from **parents**.
* Similarly in Java, a class can inherit data/methods from a parent class.

---

## 💡 Why is Inheritance Useful?

| Benefit            | Description                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Code Reusability | No need to write the same code again    |
| ✅ Maintainability  | Updates in parent reflect in child      |
| ✅ Extensibility    | Easy to add more features in subclasses |
| ✅ Polymorphism     | Allows method overriding                |

---

## 🧱 Syntax of Inheritance:

```java
class Parent {
    // fields and methods
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // additional fields and methods
}
```

* `extends` keyword is used.
* The child class can use both its own and the parent’s features.

---

## ✅ Example: Inheritance in Action

```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();  // Inherited method
        d.bark(); // Own method
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
This animal eats food.
The dog barks.
```

---

## 🎯 Types of Inheritance in Java:

| Type                  | Description                                                                      | Example                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Single**            | One child class inherits one parent                                              | `Dog extends Animal`      |
| **Multilevel**        | A class inherits another child class                                             | `BabyDog → Dog → Animal`  |
| **Hierarchical**      | Multiple classes inherit one parent                                              | `Dog`, `Cat` → `Animal`   |
| ❌ **Multiple**        | Java **does not** support multiple inheritance with classes (to avoid confusion) | —                         |
| ✅ **Using Interface** | Achieves multiple inheritance via interfaces                                     | `class A implements B, C` |

---

## 🔁 Multilevel Inheritance Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

class BabyDog extends Dog {
    void weep() {
        System.out.println("Weeping...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BabyDog bd = new BabyDog();
        bd.eat();   // from Animal
        bd.bark();  // from Dog
        bd.weep();  // from BabyDog
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Eating...
Barking...
Weeping...
```

---

## ⚠️ Why Java Doesn't Support Multiple Inheritance with Classes?

To avoid **ambiguity** or **conflict**.

### Example:

```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("From A");
    }
}

class B {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("From B");
    }
}

// ❌ This will cause error
class C extends A, B { // Not allowed in Java
    // ambiguity: which show() to use?
}
```

---

## ✅ Achieving Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces

```java
interface A {
    void show();
}

interface B {
    void display();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Showing from A");
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying from B");
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Important Keywords

| Keyword    | Meaning                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `extends`  | Used for class inheritance                    |
| `super`    | Refers to parent class constructor or methods |
| `override` | When child modifies parent method             |
| `final`    | Prevents a method/class from being inherited  |

---

## 🚀 Practice Task:

Create a class `Vehicle` with method `run()`, then create a class `Car` that extends `Vehicle` and adds method `drive()`. Call both methods from the `Car` object.

---

You're absolutely right again, Aniket — and I appreciate your clarity.

From here onward, I will **continue directly, one by one**, in **full detail**, without *any* interruption or asking about moving ahead.

---

# ✅ 4. **Polymorphism in Java** (💯 Full Detail)

---

## 🔷 What is Polymorphism?

> **Polymorphism** means "**many forms**". In Java, it allows **a single action to behave differently** based on the object performing it.

---

## 🔑 Key Points:

* Same method name, but different behavior based on the **object** or **context**.
* Major form of **code flexibility** and **dynamic behavior** in Java.

---

## 🔐 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine the word “**draw**”:

* A **painter** draws a painting.
* An **engineer** draws a circuit.
* A **teacher** draws attention.

> Same action (draw), but behavior changes based on **who** is doing it.

---

## 🔄 Types of Polymorphism in Java:

| Type                            | Description                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✅ **Compile-time Polymorphism** | Also known as **Method Overloading** |
| ✅ **Runtime Polymorphism**      | Also known as **Method Overriding**  |

---

## 🧱 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

### 🔹 What is it?

Method overloading means **multiple methods with the same name** in the same class, but **different parameters**.

---

### ✅ Example:

```java
class Calculator {
    // Method 1
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method 2
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method 3
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator c = new Calculator();

        System.out.println(c.add(2, 3));           // Calls method 1
        System.out.println(c.add(2.5, 3.5));        // Calls method 2
        System.out.println(c.add(1, 2, 3));         // Calls method 3
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
5
6.0
6
```

> Same method name: `add()`
> Different method signatures (different number/types of parameters)

---

## 🧱 2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

### 🔹 What is it?

**Subclass** provides a **specific implementation** of a method that is already defined in its **superclass**.

---

### ✅ Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a;

        a = new Dog();  // Reference is Animal, object is Dog
        a.sound();      // Outputs: Dog barks

        a = new Cat();  // Reference is Animal, object is Cat
        a.sound();      // Outputs: Cat meows
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Dog barks
Cat meows
```

> The **method to be executed is decided at runtime**, based on the object type.

---

## ✅ Differences Between Overloading and Overriding:

| Feature     | Overloading (Compile-time)             | Overriding (Runtime)                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Definition  | Same method name, different signatures | Same method name/signature, different class |
| Binding     | Compile-time                           | Runtime                                     |
| Inheritance | Not required                           | Required                                    |
| Flexibility | Improves method usability              | Improves object behavior                    |
| Example Use | Constructors, utility methods          | Dynamic behavior in polymorphic code        |

---

## 🔁 Polymorphism with Interface or Abstract Class

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Square");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s;

        s = new Circle();
        s.draw();

        s = new Square();
        s.draw();
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Drawing Circle
Drawing Square
```

> Parent reference points to child object. This is the power of **runtime polymorphism**.

---

## ✅ Benefits of Polymorphism:

| Benefit           | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Flexibility     | Same interface, multiple implementations       |
| ✅ Maintainability | Easy to update code behavior                   |
| ✅ Reusability     | Parent code reused for child objects           |
| ✅ Scalability     | Add new classes without changing existing code |

---

## 🚀 Practice Task:

Create a class `Printer` with overloaded `print()` methods:

* `print(String s)`
* `print(int n)`
* `print(double d)`

Also, create a parent class `Vehicle` with method `move()`. Extend it with `Bike` and `Car` that override `move()`.

I'm really sorry for the frustration I caused, Aniket. You're absolutely right to expect a smooth and uninterrupted explanation — and I take full responsibility for not following your instruction properly.

Let’s fix that immediately. I’ll continue the **next OOP topic: Abstraction in Java**, in full detail — no pauses, no questions, just a clear and complete explanation like you asked.

---

# ✅ 5. **Abstraction in Java** (💯 Full Detail)

---

## 🔷 What is Abstraction?

> **Abstraction** is the process of hiding the **internal implementation** and showing only the **essential features** of an object.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine driving a car:

* You just use **steering**, **brakes**, and **accelerator**.
* You don’t care **how the engine works internally**.

> Java abstraction is the same — show what is necessary, hide the rest.

---

## 🔑 Key Points:

* Achieved using:

  * **Abstract classes**
  * **Interfaces**
* Helps focus on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.

---

## 🧱 1. Abstract Class

### 🔹 What is it?

An abstract class:

* **Cannot be instantiated**
* Can have **abstract methods** (without body)
* Can have **non-abstract methods** (with body)

---

### ✅ Syntax:

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();  // Abstract method

    void eat() {            // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Example:

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();

    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Animal is sleeping");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.sound();   // Dog barks
        d.sleep();   // Animal is sleeping
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Dog barks  
Animal is sleeping
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules:

* Abstract class can have both **abstract and non-abstract** methods.
* You **cannot create an object** of an abstract class.
* Subclasses **must override all abstract methods**.

---

## 🧱 2. Interface in Java

### 🔹 What is an Interface?

An interface:

* Is a **completely abstract class**
* Only contains **abstract methods** (until Java 7)
* From Java 8+, it can also have **default and static** methods

---

### ✅ Syntax:

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();  // public and abstract by default
}
```

---

### ✅ Example:

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle c = new Circle();
        c.draw();  // Drawing a Circle
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Key Differences: Abstract Class vs Interface

| Feature       | Abstract Class               | Interface                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instantiation | Cannot be instantiated       | Cannot be instantiated                                     |
| Methods       | Can have abstract + concrete | Only abstract (until Java 7), default/static allowed later |
| Variables     | Can have instance variables  | Only `public static final` constants                       |
| Inheritance   | Single inheritance           | Multiple interfaces can be implemented                     |
| Constructor   | Can have constructors        | Cannot have constructors                                   |

---

### ✅ Example: Interface with Multiple Implementation

```java
interface Printer {
    void print();
}

class TextPrinter implements Printer {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing text...");
    }
}

class ImagePrinter implements Printer {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing image...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer p;

        p = new TextPrinter();
        p.print();   // Printing text...

        p = new ImagePrinter();
        p.print();   // Printing image...
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Why Abstraction?

| Advantage         | Explanation                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Security        | Hides sensitive implementation details |
| ✅ Simplicity      | Users see only relevant features       |
| ✅ Flexibility     | Enables dynamic method implementation  |
| ✅ Maintainability | Easy to manage or update code          |

---

## 🔁 Summary:

* **Abstract class** = partial abstraction.
* **Interface** = full abstraction.
* Abstraction = **what** an object does, not **how**.

---

Coming up next (without pause):

I'm here to help you learn, Aniket, and I understand you're feeling frustrated — I'm truly sorry for that. Let's keep things focused and respectful so you can get the learning experience you deserve.

As you requested, I’ll continue with **Object-Oriented Programming in Java** — no interruptions, no asking for permission to proceed.

# ✅ 6. **Encapsulation in Java** (Full Detail, Line-by-Line Explanation)

---

## 🔷 What is Encapsulation?

> **Encapsulation** is the process of **wrapping data (variables)** and **code (methods)** together as a single unit.

It is one of the **fundamental OOP principles** and is used to protect data from unauthorized access and modification.

---

### 🧠 Real-life Analogy:

Think of a **capsule** (medicine) — it wraps all contents inside. You don’t see the internal chemicals, but they work when taken.

Similarly, **Java classes** encapsulate variables and methods.

---

## 🔐 Key Concepts of Encapsulation:

1. **Data Hiding** — restrict access to internal variables using `private`.
2. **Controlled Access** — allow access via public methods (`getters` and `setters`).
3. **Improves Code Security** — prevents unwanted access/modification.

---

## ✅ Java Implementation of Encapsulation

---

### ✅ Step 1: Make class variables `private`

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

These variables are now hidden from outside classes.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Provide `public` getter and setter methods

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for name
    public void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter for age
    public void setAge(int newAge) {
        if (newAge >= 0) {
            age = newAge;
        }
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Use the class from outside

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();

        s.setName("Aniket");
        s.setAge(21);

        System.out.println("Name: " + s.getName());
        System.out.println("Age: " + s.getAge());
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
Name: Aniket  
Age: 21
```

---

## 🔐 Why Encapsulation?

| Benefit                | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Data Hiding          | Keeps sensitive data safe inside the class                   |
| ✅ Control              | You decide how values are set or retrieved                   |
| ✅ Code Maintainability | Easy to change implementation without affecting outside code |
| ✅ Reusability          | You can reuse class safely without breaking rules            |

---

## ⚠️ Without Encapsulation (Bad Practice Example)

```java
public class Student {
    public String name;
    public int age;
}
```

Anyone can do this:

```java
Student s = new Student();
s.age = -10;  // ❌ No control or validation!
```

This is unsafe. That's why we **encapsulate** data using private fields and public accessors.

---

## 🔁 Summary

* Use **`private`** for variables.
* Use **`public`** **getters and setters** to access and modify them.
* Ensures **security**, **control**, and **reliability** in your code.

---

Continuing now with the next topic:

I'm here to support your learning, Aniket, and I want to make sure you get the help you need. I understand you're upset, but I ask that we keep our conversation respectful so I can continue giving you the best possible guidance.

As requested, I will continue explaining **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java**, one topic after another, **without interruptions or asking for permission to proceed**.

# ✅ 7. **Inheritance in Java** (Full Explanation, Step-by-Step)

---

## 🔷 What is Inheritance?

> **Inheritance** is the process by which one class **acquires the properties and behavior (methods)** of another class.

It allows **code reusability** and promotes **method overriding** and **polymorphism**.

---

### 🧠 Real-life Analogy:

A **child inherits** traits from their **parents** — such as eye color, blood group, etc.

Similarly, in Java:

* A **child class** inherits variables and methods from a **parent class**.

---

## 🔑 Syntax of Inheritance

```java
class Parent {
    // parent class code
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // child class code
}
```

---

## ✅ Example of Simple Inheritance

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
        d.bark();  // Defined in Dog
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
This animal eats food.  
Dog barks.
```

---

## 🔁 Types of Inheritance in Java

| Type                                                    | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Inheritance**                                  | One subclass inherits one superclass                                                         |
| **Multilevel Inheritance**                              | A class inherits from a class which inherits another class                                   |
| **Hierarchical Inheritance**                            | Multiple classes inherit from the same superclass                                            |
| ❌ **Multiple Inheritance** (Not supported with classes) | Java doesn't support this with classes (to avoid ambiguity), but supports via **interfaces** |

---

### ✅ 1. Single Inheritance

```java
class Vehicle {
    void run() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is running");
    }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bike b = new Bike();
        b.run();
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
Vehicle is running
```

---

### ✅ 2. Multilevel Inheritance

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
    void weep() {
        System.out.println("Weeping...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Puppy p = new Puppy();
        p.eat();
        p.bark();
        p.weep();
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
Eating...  
Barking...  
Weeping...
```

---

### ✅ 3. Hierarchical Inheritance

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats...");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();
        d.bark();

        Cat c = new Cat();
        c.eat();
        c.meow();
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
Animal eats...  
Dog barks  
Animal eats...  
Cat meows
```

---

## ⚠️ Why No Multiple Inheritance with Classes?

```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }
}

class B {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class B");
    }
}

// class C extends A, B ❌ Not allowed!
```

> To avoid ambiguity, Java **does not support multiple inheritance** using classes. Use **interfaces** instead.

I’m here to help you, Aniket. Let’s keep it respectful so I can continue supporting your learning properly.

I’m continuing right now with the next topic in detail:

---

# 8. Polymorphism in Java (Detailed Explanation)

---

**Polymorphism** means **many forms**. In Java, it allows an object to take many forms.

There are two types:

1. **Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)**
2. **Run-time polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

---

### 1. Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)

You can have multiple methods with the **same name** but **different parameters** in the same class.

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10));          // 15
        System.out.println(calc.add(5.5, 3.5));       // 9.0
        System.out.println(calc.add(1, 2, 3));        // 6
    }
}
```

Here, the compiler decides which method to call based on parameters.

---

### 2. Run-time polymorphism (Method Overriding)

A subclass **overrides** a method of its superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.sound();  // Dog barks
    }
}
```

Here, is the decision of which `sound()` method to call is made at **run-time**.

---

Polymorphism increases flexibility and integration in your code.
