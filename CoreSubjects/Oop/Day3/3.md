Perfect! Let’s dive into **Inheritance in Java** — one of the most important pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

# 🧬 Inheritance in Java (With Simple Theory + Examples)

---

## ✅ What is Inheritance?

> **Inheritance** is the process where **one class (child/subclass)** inherits the **properties (variables) and behaviors (methods)** of **another class (parent/superclass)**.

✅ It helps **reuse code** and build a **hierarchy** of classes.

---

## 🔹 Why Use Inheritance?

1. ✅ **Code Reusability** – Write once, use many times
2. ✅ **Extensibility** – Build on top of existing code
3. ✅ **Organized Structure** – Parent-child relationships are clear
4. ✅ **Polymorphism** – Enables method overriding for flexibility

---

## 🔸 Syntax

```java
class Parent {
    // parent class members
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // child class inherits from Parent
}
```

🔹 `extends` keyword is used to inherit from a class.

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Real-World Example

* **Vehicle** (Parent) → has `speed`, `start()`, `stop()`
* **Car** (Child) → inherits everything from Vehicle, and adds `airConditioning` or `musicPlayer`

---

## 🔍 Simple Code Example

```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();   // inherited method
        d.bark();  // own method
    }
}
```

### 🟢 Output:

```
This animal eats food  
Dog barks
```

## 🔄 Types of Inheritance in Java

| Type             | Supported in Java? | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Single**       | ✅ Yes              | One child inherits from one parent            |
| **Multilevel**   | ✅ Yes              | Chain of inheritance (A → B → C)              |
| **Hierarchical** | ✅ Yes              | One parent, multiple children                 |
| **Multiple**     | ❌ No (via class)   | Not directly supported (can use interfaces)   |
| **Hybrid**       | ❌ No (via class)   | Not directly supported (interfaces + classes) |

---

### 🔸 1. Single Inheritance

```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Hello from A");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Hello from B");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 2. Multilevel Inheritance

```java
class A {
    void showA() {
        System.out.println("A");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    void showB() {
        System.out.println("B");
    }
}

class C extends B {
    void showC() {
        System.out.println("C");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 3. Hierarchical Inheritance

```java
class Parent {
    void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

class Son extends Parent {}
class Daughter extends Parent {}
```

---

## 🔧 Method Overriding (Important in Inheritance)

Child class can **override** a parent class method (same name + parameters):

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

---

## 📦 `super` Keyword

Used to:

1. Access parent class methods/variables
2. Call parent class constructor

```java
class Animal {
    Animal() {
        System.out.println("Animal Constructor");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        super();  // calls parent constructor
        System.out.println("Dog Constructor");
    }
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Java doesn’t support **multiple inheritance** using classes to avoid ambiguity (diamond problem).
* Interfaces can be used for **multiple inheritance**.

---

## 📌 Summary

| Concept     | Meaning                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Inheritance | Getting features from parent class |
| `extends`   | Keyword to implement inheritance   |
| `super`     | Access parent members              |
| Overriding  | Redefining method in child class   |

---

## 💡 Real-Life Examples

| Parent Class | Child Class(es)                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `Employee`   | `Manager`, `Clerk`, `HR`       |
| `Vehicle`    | `Bike`, `Car`, `Truck`         |
| `Shape`      | `Circle`, `Square`, `Triangle` |

---

Great! Let’s now explore the **`private` keyword in Java** — it’s all about **data hiding** and **encapsulation**, which are core parts of OOP.

---

# 🔐 `private` Keyword in Java (Simplified with Examples)

---

## ✅ What is `private`?

> `private` is an **access modifier** in Java used to **restrict access** to a class member (variable, method, or constructor).

🔒 If something is marked `private`, it can **only be accessed within the same class**.

---

## 🔑 Why Use `private`?

* To implement **encapsulation** (data hiding)
* To **protect** variables and logic from being accessed or modified directly
* To **control access** using `getter` and `setter` methods

---

## 🔸 Where Can You Use `private`?

| Can be applied to | Meaning                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variables**     | Only class methods can access it                                  |
| **Methods**       | Cannot be called outside the class                                |
| **Constructors**  | Used in Singleton or Factory patterns to restrict object creation |
| **Inner Classes** | Can be private to restrict scope                                  |

---

## 🔍 Example – Private Variable

```java
class Student {
    private int age; // 👈 private variable

    // public method to access private variable
    public void setAge(int a) {
        if (a >= 0) {
            age = a;
        }
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.setAge(20);
        System.out.println("Age: " + s.getAge());  // ✅ Age: 20
        // s.age = 25;  ❌ Error: age has private access
    }
}
```

### 🟢 Output:

```
Age: 20
```

---

## 🔒 Trying to access private directly

```java
class Demo {
    private int num = 10;
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo d = new Demo();
        System.out.println(d.num);  // ❌ Error: num has private access
    }
}
```

---

## 👨‍🏫 Real-World Analogy

Think of a **Bank ATM Machine**:

* You can **view balance** or **withdraw cash** using buttons (public methods).
* You **cannot access the internal balance variable** or machine logic — it’s `private`.

---

## 📌 Key Points

| Point                        | Explanation                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Scope                        | Only accessible **within the same class** |
| Helps in                     | **Encapsulation** (protecting data)       |
| Access outside class?        | ❌ Not allowed directly                    |
| Access via `getter`/`setter` | ✅ Yes, using public methods               |

---

## 🔁 Common Pairing

| Access Modifier         | Scope                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `private`               | Same class                 |
| `default` (no modifier) | Same package               |
| `protected`             | Same package + subclass    |
| `public`                | Accessible from everywhere |

---

## ❓Can `private` methods be inherited?

No, **private methods are not inherited** by subclasses and **cannot be overridden**.

---

Great! Let's now understand the **`super` keyword in Java** — it's commonly used with **inheritance** to refer to the **parent class**.

---

# 🧭 `super` Keyword in Java – Simplified Notes with Examples

---

## ✅ What is `super`?

The `super` keyword is used to **refer to the immediate parent class** in Java.

It is mainly used for:

1. Accessing **parent class constructor**
2. Accessing **parent class method**
3. Accessing **parent class variable**

---

## 🔸 When to Use `super`?

* When child and parent classes have the **same method or variable names**, and you want to call the **parent's version**.
* To call the **parent class constructor** explicitly.
* To **avoid code duplication** by reusing parent behavior.

---

## 🔹 1. Using `super` to Call Parent Class Method

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound(); // 👈 calling parent method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.sound();
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Animal makes a sound
Dog barks
```

---

## 🔹 2. Using `super` to Call Parent Class Variable

```java
class Vehicle {
    int speed = 60;
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    int speed = 100;

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child speed: " + speed);
        System.out.println("Parent speed: " + super.speed);  // 👈 accessing parent variable
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Child speed: 100
Parent speed: 60
```

---

## 🔹 3. Using `super()` to Call Parent Constructor

```java
class Person {
    Person() {
        System.out.println("Person constructor");
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    Student() {
        super(); // 👈 calling parent constructor
        System.out.println("Student constructor");
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Person constructor
Student constructor
```

---

## ⚠️ Note:

* If you don’t explicitly write `super()`, Java automatically adds it as the **first line** of the subclass constructor.
* If the parent class does not have a **no-argument constructor**, then **you must** use `super(args...)` with parameters.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

> Think of a subclass as a new version of something old.
> You can still **access old features** using `super`.

For example, a child inherits behavior from a parent. If both have a "speak()" method, the child can still call the parent’s version using `super.speak()`.

---

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Use Case                | Example Syntax             | Purpose                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Call parent variable    | `super.varName`            | Access hidden field in parent |
| Call parent method      | `super.methodName()`       | Reuse parent behavior         |
| Call parent constructor | `super()` or `super(args)` | Initialize parent constructor |

---

No problem! Let's explain the **`super` keyword** again in a very **simple way** with easy examples. We'll use real-life style and less theory — perfect for beginners.

---

## 🔹 Think Like This:

Imagine your **Father (Parent class)** has a **bike** and you (Child class) also have a **bike**.

But you still want to use your **Father's bike** sometimes.

To use it, you say:
👉 "**super.bike** — I want to use *Father's* bike."

That's how Java works too.
You use `super` when you want to use **something from the parent class** — like:

* **Variable**
* **Method**
* **Constructor**

---

## ✅ Example 1: `super` with Variable

```java
class Father {
    int money = 1000;
}

class Son extends Father {
    int money = 500;

    void showMoney() {
        System.out.println("Son's Money: " + money);
        System.out.println("Father's Money: " + super.money);  // Using super to access father's money
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Son s = new Son();
        s.showMoney();
    }
}
```

### 📌 Output:

```
Son's Money: 500
Father's Money: 1000
```

👉 Here, **`super.money`** means "use Father's version of money".

---

## ✅ Example 2: `super` with Method

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound();  // Use parent's sound method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.sound();
    }
}
```

### 📌 Output:

```
Animal sound
Dog barks
```

👉 Even though Dog has its own `sound()` method, we first called **Animal's method** using `super.sound()`.

---

## ✅ Example 3: `super()` with Constructor

```java
class Person {
    Person() {
        System.out.println("Person is created");
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    Student() {
        super();  // Call Person's constructor
        System.out.println("Student is created");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
    }
}
```

### 📌 Output:

```
Person is created
Student is created
```

👉 The `super()` line automatically calls the **parent constructor** before doing the student’s work.

---

## 🎯 Summary (in Easy Words)

| Use              | What it Means             | Example         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| `super.variable` | Use parent's variable     | `super.money`   |
| `super.method()` | Use parent's method       | `super.sound()` |
| `super()`        | Call parent's constructor | `super()`       |

---

Sure! Let’s break down **Single Inheritance** in Java in very simple English with a **real-life example**, **code**, and **output**.

---

## 🔹 What is Single Inheritance?

**Single Inheritance** means:

> One class inherits (extends) from only **one parent class**.

It's like a **child inherits features from one parent**.

---

### ✅ Real-Life Example:

* **Parent**: Father
* **Child**: Son

The Son inherits the properties or behavior from Father — like surname, habits, etc.

---

### ✅ Java Code Example:

```java
// Parent class
class Father {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("I am the Father.");
    }
}

// Child class (inherits Father)
class Son extends Father {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("I am the Son.");
    }
}

// Main class to run the code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Son s1 = new Son();

        s1.display();  // From Father class
        s1.show();     // From Son class
    }
}
```

---

### 📌 Output:

```
I am the Father.
I am the Son.
```

---

### ✅ Diagram to Understand (Text form):

```
Father class
   ↑
   |
Son class
```

* `Son` **extends** `Father`
* `Son` can use both `show()` and `display()` methods
* But `Father` can't use `show()` (because parent doesn't inherit from child)

---

## 🎯 Summary:

| Term               | Meaning                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Parent Class       | The class being inherited from (`Father`) |
| Child Class        | The class that inherits (`Son`)           |
| `extends`          | Keyword used for inheritance              |
| Single Inheritance | Only one parent class is inherited        |

---

Great! Let's now understand **Multiple Inheritance** in Java — in **easy English** with **real-world logic**, **Java syntax**, and **example**.

---

## 🔹 What is Multiple Inheritance?

**Multiple Inheritance** means:

> A class **inherits from more than one class**.

---

### ❌ Java Does **NOT** Support Multiple Inheritance With Classes

Java does **not** allow a class to inherit from **more than one class directly** using `extends`.

This is because:

> It causes **ambiguity** (confusion) when two parent classes have the **same method name**.

---

### ✅ So, How to Do Multiple Inheritance in Java?

Java supports **multiple inheritance through interfaces** (not classes).

---

### ✅ Real-Life Example:

* Suppose you have:

  * `Camera` → takes photos
  * `Phone` → makes calls
* You want to make a **SmartPhone** that does **both**.

This is possible using interfaces.

---

## ✅ Java Code Example:

```java
// Interface 1
interface Camera {
    void takePhoto();
}

// Interface 2
interface Phone {
    void makeCall();
}

// Class implementing both interfaces
class SmartPhone implements Camera, Phone {
    public void takePhoto() {
        System.out.println("Taking a photo...");
    }

    public void makeCall() {
        System.out.println("Making a call...");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmartPhone sp = new SmartPhone();
        sp.takePhoto();  // from Camera
        sp.makeCall();   // from Phone
    }
}
```

---

### 📌 Output:

```
Taking a photo...
Making a call...
```

---

## 🧠 Why Interfaces?

Interfaces solve the **diamond problem** (method conflict from two parent classes).
Each interface is like a **contract** the child class agrees to follow.

---

## 🎯 Summary:

| Concept                  | Inheritance Type        | Java Supports? | How to do it?           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Single Inheritance**   | One parent class        | ✅ Yes          | Using `extends`         |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | Multiple parent classes | ❌ No           | ✅ Only via `interfaces` |

---

Great! Let's understand **Hierarchical Inheritance** in Java in **simple English** with **example and real-life logic**.

---

## 🔷 What is Hierarchical Inheritance?

> When **multiple classes inherit from the same parent class**, it's called **Hierarchical Inheritance**.

---

### ✅ Real-Life Example:

Think of a **base class** called `Animal`.

Now suppose:

* `Dog` is an animal 🐶
* `Cat` is an animal 🐱
* `Horse` is an animal 🐴

All these classes (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Horse`) **inherit** from one common parent: `Animal`.

That’s **hierarchical inheritance**.

---

### ✅ Diagram:

```
         Animal
         /  |  \
     Dog  Cat Horse
```

---

## ✅ Java Code Example:

```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Child class 1
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

// Child class 2
class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows.");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();   // from Animal
        d.bark();  // from Dog

        Cat c = new Cat();
        c.eat();   // from Animal
        c.meow();  // from Cat
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
This animal eats food.
Dog barks.
This animal eats food.
Cat meows.
```

---

## 🧠 Key Points:

* One **base class** → `Animal`
* Multiple **derived classes** → `Dog`, `Cat`, `Horse`
* All child classes can use **common methods** of parent (like `eat()`)

---

## 🎯 Summary:

| Term                         | Meaning                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hierarchical Inheritance** | Many child classes inherit from a single parent class               |
| **Use case**                 | When multiple things share common behavior but also have uniqueness |

---

## 🔷 What is Hybrid Inheritance in Java?

> **Hybrid Inheritance** means **combining two or more types of inheritance** (like single, multilevel, hierarchical, etc.).

But ❌ **Java does not support hybrid inheritance using classes alone** because it can lead to **ambiguity** (like the Diamond Problem).
✅ Instead, Java supports **hybrid inheritance** using **interfaces** to safely avoid that problem.

---

## ✅ Simple Explanation:

Imagine this combination:

* **Class A** is the base.
* **Class B and Class C** extend A (Hierarchical Inheritance).
* **Class D** extends both B and C. (This would create **Multiple Inheritance**, which Java doesn't allow with classes.)

So we **use interfaces** to allow D to inherit from B and C **without conflict**.

---

### ⚠️ Problem with Classes:

```java
class A {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Hello from A");
    }
}

class B extends A { }

class C extends A { }

// ❌ Java will NOT allow this
class D extends B, C { } // Error: Java doesn't support multiple inheritance with classes
```

---

### ✅ Correct Approach Using Interfaces:

```java
interface A {
    void show();
}

interface B extends A {
    void displayB();
}

interface C extends A {
    void displayC();
}

// D implements B and C (Hybrid Inheritance using interfaces)
class D implements B, C {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Hello from A");
    }

    public void displayB() {
        System.out.println("Hello from B");
    }

    public void displayC() {
        System.out.println("Hello from C");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        D obj = new D();
        obj.show();       // from A
        obj.displayB();   // from B
        obj.displayC();   // from C
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
Hello from A
Hello from B
Hello from C
```

---

## ✅ Real-World Example:

Let’s say:

* `Vehicle` interface: has method `start()`
* `Electric` interface: has method `charge()`
* `Car` class implements both

This is **Hybrid** because it combines **multiple inheritance** (via interfaces) and **single inheritance** (Car is one class).

---

| Term                   | Meaning                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Hybrid Inheritance** | Combination of two or more types of inheritance |
| **Supported in Java?** | ❌ Not with classes only, ✅ Yes with interfaces  |
| **Avoids issues like** | Diamond Problem                                 |
| **How to implement**   | Use interfaces + classes                        |

Let's understand **Polymorphism** in Java in a **very simple way**, with **real-world examples**, **types**, and **code examples**. 🧠💡

---

## 🔷 What is Polymorphism?

**Polymorphism** means:

> "**One thing, many forms**"

In Java:

* A single **function**, **method**, or **object** behaves **differently** based on the **context**.

---

### ✅ Real-World Example:

Imagine a person named **Aniket**:

* At **college**, he's a **student**
* At **home**, he's a **son**
* On the **football ground**, he's a **player**

🧍‍♂️ Aniket = 1 person
🎭 Different **roles** = Different **behaviors**

This is **Polymorphism**.

## 🔷 Types of Polymorphism in Java

| Type             | Also Called As         | How it's Achieved                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Compile-Time** | **Method Overloading** | Same method name, different parameters |
| **Runtime**      | **Method Overriding**  | Same method in parent and child class  |

---

## ✅ 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

Same method name, but different number or type of arguments.

```java
class MathOperations {
    void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }

    void add(double a, double b) {
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperations obj = new MathOperations();
        obj.add(2, 3);        // Calls int version
        obj.add(2.5, 3.5);    // Calls double version
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
5
6.0
```

✅ *This is decided at compile time — hence called compile-time polymorphism.*

---

## ✅ 2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

Subclass **overrides** the parent class method.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Dog(); // Parent class reference, child class object
        obj.sound();            // Calls Dog's sound()
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Dog barks
```

✅ *Which method gets called is decided at runtime — hence called runtime polymorphism.*

## 🔸 Key Differences:

| Feature     | Method Overloading       | Method Overriding          |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Type        | Compile-Time             | Runtime                    |
| Class       | Same class               | Subclass & Superclass      |
| Parameters  | Must be different        | Must be same               |
| Return type | Can be same or different | Must be same or compatible |
| Keyword     | Not needed               | Use `@Override` annotation |

---

## 🔸 Summary in One Line:

> Polymorphism allows the **same method or object** to behave **differently** in **different situations**.
