Perfect! Let’s dive into **Inheritance in Java** — one of the most important pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

# 🧬 Inheritance in Java (With Simple Theory + Examples)

---

## ✅ What is Inheritance?

> **Inheritance** is the process where **one class (child/subclass)** inherits the **properties (variables) and behaviors (methods)** of **another class (parent/superclass)**.

✅ It helps **reuse code** and build a **hierarchy** of classes.

---

## 🔹 Why Use Inheritance?

1. ✅ **Code Reusability** – Write once, use many times
2. ✅ **Extensibility** – Build on top of existing code
3. ✅ **Organized Structure** – Parent-child relationships are clear
4. ✅ **Polymorphism** – Enables method overriding for flexibility

---

## 🔸 Syntax

```java
class Parent {
    // parent class members
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // child class inherits from Parent
}
```

🔹 `extends` keyword is used to inherit from a class.

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Real-World Example

* **Vehicle** (Parent) → has `speed`, `start()`, `stop()`
* **Car** (Child) → inherits everything from Vehicle, and adds `airConditioning` or `musicPlayer`

---

## 🔍 Simple Code Example

```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();   // inherited method
        d.bark();  // own method
    }
}
```

### 🟢 Output:

```
This animal eats food  
Dog barks
```

## 🔄 Types of Inheritance in Java

| Type             | Supported in Java? | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Single**       | ✅ Yes              | One child inherits from one parent            |
| **Multilevel**   | ✅ Yes              | Chain of inheritance (A → B → C)              |
| **Hierarchical** | ✅ Yes              | One parent, multiple children                 |
| **Multiple**     | ❌ No (via class)   | Not directly supported (can use interfaces)   |
| **Hybrid**       | ❌ No (via class)   | Not directly supported (interfaces + classes) |

---

### 🔸 1. Single Inheritance

```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Hello from A");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Hello from B");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 2. Multilevel Inheritance

```java
class A {
    void showA() {
        System.out.println("A");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    void showB() {
        System.out.println("B");
    }
}

class C extends B {
    void showC() {
        System.out.println("C");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 3. Hierarchical Inheritance

```java
class Parent {
    void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

class Son extends Parent {}
class Daughter extends Parent {}
```

---

## 🔧 Method Overriding (Important in Inheritance)

Child class can **override** a parent class method (same name + parameters):

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

---

## 📦 `super` Keyword

Used to:

1. Access parent class methods/variables
2. Call parent class constructor

```java
class Animal {
    Animal() {
        System.out.println("Animal Constructor");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        super();  // calls parent constructor
        System.out.println("Dog Constructor");
    }
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Java doesn’t support **multiple inheritance** using classes to avoid ambiguity (diamond problem).
* Interfaces can be used for **multiple inheritance**.

---

## 📌 Summary

| Concept     | Meaning                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Inheritance | Getting features from parent class |
| `extends`   | Keyword to implement inheritance   |
| `super`     | Access parent members              |
| Overriding  | Redefining method in child class   |

---

## 💡 Real-Life Examples

| Parent Class | Child Class(es)                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `Employee`   | `Manager`, `Clerk`, `HR`       |
| `Vehicle`    | `Bike`, `Car`, `Truck`         |
| `Shape`      | `Circle`, `Square`, `Triangle` |

---

Great! Let’s now explore the **`private` keyword in Java** — it’s all about **data hiding** and **encapsulation**, which are core parts of OOP.

---

# 🔐 `private` Keyword in Java (Simplified with Examples)

---

## ✅ What is `private`?

> `private` is an **access modifier** in Java used to **restrict access** to a class member (variable, method, or constructor).

🔒 If something is marked `private`, it can **only be accessed within the same class**.

---

## 🔑 Why Use `private`?

* To implement **encapsulation** (data hiding)
* To **protect** variables and logic from being accessed or modified directly
* To **control access** using `getter` and `setter` methods

---

## 🔸 Where Can You Use `private`?

| Can be applied to | Meaning                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variables**     | Only class methods can access it                                  |
| **Methods**       | Cannot be called outside the class                                |
| **Constructors**  | Used in Singleton or Factory patterns to restrict object creation |
| **Inner Classes** | Can be private to restrict scope                                  |

---

## 🔍 Example – Private Variable

```java
class Student {
    private int age; // 👈 private variable

    // public method to access private variable
    public void setAge(int a) {
        if (a >= 0) {
            age = a;
        }
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.setAge(20);
        System.out.println("Age: " + s.getAge());  // ✅ Age: 20
        // s.age = 25;  ❌ Error: age has private access
    }
}
```

### 🟢 Output:

```
Age: 20
```

---

## 🔒 Trying to access private directly

```java
class Demo {
    private int num = 10;
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo d = new Demo();
        System.out.println(d.num);  // ❌ Error: num has private access
    }
}
```

---

## 👨‍🏫 Real-World Analogy

Think of a **Bank ATM Machine**:

* You can **view balance** or **withdraw cash** using buttons (public methods).
* You **cannot access the internal balance variable** or machine logic — it’s `private`.

## 📌 Key Points

| Point                        | Explanation                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Scope                        | Only accessible **within the same class** |
| Helps in                     | **Encapsulation** (protecting data)       |
| Access outside class?        | ❌ Not allowed directly                    |
| Access via `getter`/`setter` | ✅ Yes, using public methods               |

---

## 🔁 Common Pairing

| Access Modifier         | Scope                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `private`               | Same class                 |
| `default` (no modifier) | Same package               |
| `protected`             | Same package + subclass    |
| `public`                | Accessible from everywhere |

---

## ❓Can `private` methods be inherited?

No, **private methods are not inherited** by subclasses and **cannot be overridden**.

---

Great! Let's now understand the **`super` keyword in Java** — it's commonly used with **inheritance** to refer to the **parent class**.

---

# 🧭 `super` Keyword in Java – Simplified Notes with Examples

---

## ✅ What is `super`?

The `super` keyword is used to **refer to the immediate parent class** in Java.

It is mainly used for:

1. Accessing **parent class constructor**
2. Accessing **parent class method**
3. Accessing **parent class variable**

---

## 🔸 When to Use `super`?

* When child and parent classes have the **same method or variable names**, and you want to call the **parent's version**.
* To call the **parent class constructor** explicitly.
* To **avoid code duplication** by reusing parent behavior.

---

## 🔹 1. Using `super` to Call Parent Class Method

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound(); // 👈 calling parent method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.sound();
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Animal makes a sound
Dog barks
```

---

## 🔹 2. Using `super` to Call Parent Class Variable

```java
class Vehicle {
    int speed = 60;
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    int speed = 100;

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child speed: " + speed);
        System.out.println("Parent speed: " + super.speed);  // 👈 accessing parent variable
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Child speed: 100
Parent speed: 60
```

---

## 🔹 3. Using `super()` to Call Parent Constructor

```java
class Person {
    Person() {
        System.out.println("Person constructor");
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    Student() {
        super(); // 👈 calling parent constructor
        System.out.println("Student constructor");
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Person constructor
Student constructor
```

---

## ⚠️ Note:

* If you don’t explicitly write `super()`, Java automatically adds it as the **first line** of the subclass constructor.
* If the parent class does not have a **no-argument constructor**, then **you must** use `super(args...)` with parameters.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

> Think of a subclass as a new version of something old.
> You can still **access old features** using `super`.

For example, a child inherits behavior from a parent. If both have a "speak()" method, the child can still call the parent’s version using `super.speak()`.

---

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Use Case                | Example Syntax             | Purpose                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Call parent variable    | `super.varName`            | Access hidden field in parent |
| Call parent method      | `super.methodName()`       | Reuse parent behavior         |
| Call parent constructor | `super()` or `super(args)` | Initialize parent constructor |

---

No problem! Let's explain the **`super` keyword** again in a very **simple way** with easy examples. We'll use real-life style and less theory — perfect for beginners.

---

## 🔹 Think Like This:

Imagine your **Father (Parent class)** has a **bike** and you (Child class) also have a **bike**.

But you still want to use your **Father's bike** sometimes.

To use it, you say:
👉 "**super.bike** — I want to use *Father's* bike."

That's how Java works too.
You use `super` when you want to use **something from the parent class** — like:

* **Variable**
* **Method**
* **Constructor**

---

## ✅ Example 1: `super` with Variable

```java
class Father {
    int money = 1000;
}

class Son extends Father {
    int money = 500;

    void showMoney() {
        System.out.println("Son's Money: " + money);
        System.out.println("Father's Money: " + super.money);  // Using super to access father's money
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Son s = new Son();
        s.showMoney();
    }
}
```

### 📌 Output:

```
Son's Money: 500
Father's Money: 1000
```

👉 Here, **`super.money`** means "use Father's version of money".

---

## ✅ Example 2: `super` with Method

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound();  // Use parent's sound method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.sound();
    }
}
```

### 📌 Output:

```
Animal sound
Dog barks
```

👉 Even though Dog has its own `sound()` method, we first called **Animal's method** using `super.sound()`.

---

## ✅ Example 3: `super()` with Constructor

```java
class Person {
    Person() {
        System.out.println("Person is created");
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    Student() {
        super();  // Call Person's constructor
        System.out.println("Student is created");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
    }
}
```

### 📌 Output:

```
Person is created
Student is created
```

👉 The `super()` line automatically calls the **parent constructor** before doing the student’s work.

## 🎯 Summary (in Easy Words)

| Use              | What it Means             | Example         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| `super.variable` | Use parent's variable     | `super.money`   |
| `super.method()` | Use parent's method       | `super.sound()` |
| `super()`        | Call parent's constructor | `super()`       |

---

Sure! Let’s break down **Single Inheritance** in Java in very simple English with a **real-life example**, **code**, and **output**.

---

## 🔹 What is Single Inheritance?

**Single Inheritance** means:

> One class inherits (extends) from only **one parent class**.

It's like a **child inherits features from one parent**.

---

### ✅ Real-Life Example:

* **Parent**: Father
* **Child**: Son

The Son inherits the properties or behavior from Father — like surname, habits, etc.

---

### ✅ Java Code Example:

```java
// Parent class
class Father {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("I am the Father.");
    }
}

// Child class (inherits Father)
class Son extends Father {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("I am the Son.");
    }
}

// Main class to run the code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Son s1 = new Son();

        s1.display();  // From Father class
        s1.show();     // From Son class
    }
}
```

---

### 📌 Output:

```
I am the Father.
I am the Son.
```

---

### ✅ Diagram to Understand (Text form):

```
Father class
   ↑
   |
Son class
```

* `Son` **extends** `Father`
* `Son` can use both `show()` and `display()` methods
* But `Father` can't use `show()` (because parent doesn't inherit from child)

---

## 🎯 Summary:

| Term               | Meaning                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Parent Class       | The class being inherited from (`Father`) |
| Child Class        | The class that inherits (`Son`)           |
| `extends`          | Keyword used for inheritance              |
| Single Inheritance | Only one parent class is inherited        |
