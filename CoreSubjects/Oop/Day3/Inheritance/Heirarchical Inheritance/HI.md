Great! Let's understand **Hierarchical Inheritance** in Java in **simple English** with **example and real-life logic**.

---

## 🔷 What is Hierarchical Inheritance?

> When **multiple classes inherit from the same parent class**, it's called **Hierarchical Inheritance**.

---

### ✅ Real-Life Example:

Think of a **base class** called `Animal`.

Now suppose:

* `Dog` is an animal 🐶
* `Cat` is an animal 🐱
* `Horse` is an animal 🐴

All these classes (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Horse`) **inherit** from one common parent: `Animal`.

That’s **hierarchical inheritance**.

---

### ✅ Diagram:

```
         Animal
         /  |  \
     Dog  Cat Horse
```

---

## ✅ Java Code Example:

```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Child class 1
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

// Child class 2
class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows.");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();   // from Animal
        d.bark();  // from Dog

        Cat c = new Cat();
        c.eat();   // from Animal
        c.meow();  // from Cat
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
This animal eats food.
Dog barks.
This animal eats food.
Cat meows.
```

---

## 🧠 Key Points:

* One **base class** → `Animal`
* Multiple **derived classes** → `Dog`, `Cat`, `Horse`
* All child classes can use **common methods** of parent (like `eat()`)

## 🎯 Summary:

| Term                         | Meaning                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hierarchical Inheritance** | Many child classes inherit from a single parent class               |
| **Use case**                 | When multiple things share common behavior but also have uniqueness |

Let me know if you want to try **Multilevel Inheritance** next (i.e., Parent → Child → Grandchild)?
