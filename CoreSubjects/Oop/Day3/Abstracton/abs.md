## ✅ What is **Abstraction** in Java?

**Abstraction** means **hiding internal details** and showing **only essential features** to the user.

> You don’t need to know **how** something works — just **what** it does.

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Example

Think of a **car**:

* You press the brake pedal → Car slows down.
* You **don’t know or care** how hydraulic systems work inside.

You're using an **abstract view** of the brake system.

## 👨‍💻 Java Example of Abstraction (Using Abstract Class)

```java
// File: Main.java

// 👻 Abstract class - can't create object from this directly
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method - no body, only idea
    abstract void sound();

    // Normal method
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animals eat food");
    }
}

// 🐶 Subclass gives the actual implementation of the method
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
        d.eat();   // Output: Animals eat food

        Cat c = new Cat();
        c.sound(); // Output: Cat meows
        c.eat();   // Output: Animals eat food
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Output:

```
Dog barks
Animals eat food
Cat meows
Animals eat food
```

## 🎯 Key Points About Abstraction

| Feature             | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Abstract class      | Cannot be directly instantiated                        |
| Abstract method     | Has no body; must be implemented by subclasses         |
| Partial abstraction | Abstract class can have both abstract + normal methods |
| Interface           | Provides 100% abstraction (you’ll learn next)          |

## 💬 Why Abstraction Is Useful

* You **focus on what** something does, not how.
* You **avoid complexity** and keep code **clean**.
* You **enforce rules** that every subclass must follow.

## 📌 Summary:

> **Abstraction = Idea without details**
> Think **"what it does"**, not **"how it does it"**
