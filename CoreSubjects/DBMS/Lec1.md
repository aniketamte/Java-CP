### 📌 **What is Data?**

**Data** is a collection of raw facts and figures that **do not have any meaning on their own**.

It can be **numbers, characters, symbols, images**, or even **audio/video files** — basically **anything** that can be processed by a computer.

---

### ✅ **Simple Example:**

| Name   | Age | City   |
| ------ | --- | ------ |
| Aniket | 22  | Pune   |
| Priya  | 25  | Mumbai |

Each value (like "Aniket", 22, "Pune") is **data**.

---

### 🎯 **In short:**

> Data is unprocessed information that is collected and stored for processing.

---

### 📌 **2. Types of Data**

Data is mainly divided into two types:

---

## 🔢 A. Quantitative Data

> Data that can be **measured or counted** (in numbers).

### ✅ i. Numerical Form

* This includes numbers like 10, 45.6, etc.

### ✅ ii. Examples:

* **Weight** of a bag = 5 kg
* **Volume** of water = 2 liters
* **Cost** of an item = ₹500

---

## ✏️ B. Qualitative Data

> Data that is **descriptive**, not expressed in numbers.

### ✅ i. Descriptive, Not Numerical

* Tells **qualities** or **characteristics**.

### ✅ ii. Examples:

* **Name** = Aniket
* **Gender** = Male
* **Hair Color** = Black

### 📊 **DBMS Architecture Explanation (Based on Diagram)**

![DBMS Diagram](attachment)

---

### 🔄 **Flow of Data:**

1. **📦 Database** (Purple Circle):

   * This is where all the actual **data is stored** (like tables of students, employees, products, etc.).
   * It is just the storage area – not directly used by users or apps.

2. **🌀 DBMS** (Middle Circle):

   * This is the **Database Management System**.
   * It acts like a **bridge** between the database and the external world.
   * It **controls access**, manages the data, and provides tools to store, fetch, update, or delete data.

3. **🔗 API Connections**:

   * **API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.
   * It’s like a set of rules that allow external systems to **communicate with the DBMS** securely.

4. **👤 User and 🧩 Apps (Blue Circles)**:

   * Users (like admins, analysts, etc.) and apps (like websites, mobile apps, etc.) **connect to the DBMS via API** to use or manage data.
   * They never access the database directly — they always go **through the DBMS**.

---

### 🧠 **Simple Summary:**

> The **DBMS is the manager** that:
>
> * Talks to the database,
> * Handles data requests from apps or users, and
> * Makes sure everything is secure and efficient.
