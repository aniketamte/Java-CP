# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics — Simple Notes with Examples

---

## 🔷 What is a **Class**?

### 🔹 Definition:

A **class** is like a **blueprint or design**.
It does not store any data itself, but it defines **what an object will contain and what it can do**.

### 🔹 Key Points:

* Think of a class as a **template**.
* It holds **variables** (also called fields) and **methods** (functions).
* Used to create objects.

### 🧠 Real-world Example:

A **Car class** defines:

* Properties: brand, color, speed
* Behavior: drive(), brake()

But no actual car exists yet — it’s just a plan!

### 🧾 Java Syntax:

```java
class Car {
    String color;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving...");
    }
}
```

---

## 🔷 What is an **Object**?

### 🔹 Definition:

An **object** is a **real version of a class**. It uses memory and you can use it to **access the class’s methods or variables**.

### 🧠 Real-world Example:

From the Car class, you can create an object:

* `Car myCar = new Car();`
  This creates a **real car** in memory.

### 🧾 Java Syntax:

```java
Car myCar = new Car();  // Object creation
```

### 🔹 Notes:

* **Class = Logical design**
* **Object = Physical thing** stored in memory

---

## 🔷 What is a **Constructor**?

### 🔹 Definition:

A **constructor** is a special method that:

* Has the **same name as the class**
* Is called **automatically** when object is created
* **Initializes** the object

### 🧠 Real-world Example:

When you buy a phone, it’s already **set up** with basic apps.
Similarly, a constructor sets up the object with default or custom values.

---

### ✅ Types of Constructors:

#### 1. **Default Constructor** (No arguments)

If you don’t write one, Java gives you a default constructor.

```java
class Bike {
    Bike() {
        System.out.println("Bike created");
    }
}
```

When you create a new `Bike`, this runs automatically.

#### 2. **Parameterized Constructor** (Takes arguments)

Used to set values while creating the object.

```java
class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    Student(String n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }
}
```

```java
Student s1 = new Student("Aniket", 21);
```

---

## 🔷 What is the `this` Keyword?

### 🔹 Definition:

`this` refers to the **current object**.

### 🔹 Why use `this`?

When **parameter names** and **class variable names** are the same, `this` helps avoid confusion.

### ❌ Without `this`:

```java
Employee(String name) {
    name = name;  // Confusing! Both refer to parameter
}
```

### ✅ With `this`:

```java
Employee(String name) {
    this.name = name;  // Correct — sets instance variable
}
```

---

## 🔷 Instance Variables

Variables inside an object are called **instance variables**.
Each object has its **own copy**.

---

## 🔷 Dynamic Memory Allocation (new keyword)

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
```

* `new` keyword **allocates memory at runtime**
* Returns the **reference** to the new object

---

## 🔷 Constructor Overloading

You can write **multiple constructors** with different parameters.

```java
Student() { }
Student(int rno, String name, float marks) { }
Student(Student other) { }  // Copy constructor
```

You can even **call one constructor from another** using `this()`.

```java
Student() {
    this(10, "Default", 99.0f);
}
```

---

## 🔷 Real-World Java Example: Full Code Breakdown

```java
class Student {
    int rno;
    String name;
    float marks;

    // Greeting method
    void greeting() {
        System.out.println("Hi, I'm " + name);
    }

    // Change name method
    void changeName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    Student(Student other) {
        this.rno = other.rno;
        this.name = other.name;
        this.marks = other.marks;
    }

    // Default Constructor
    Student() {
        this(50, "Default Person", 90.0f);  // Calls another constructor
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Student(int rno, String name, float marks) {
        this.rno = rno;
        this.name = name;
        this.marks = marks;
    }
}
```

---

## 🔷 Wrapper Classes

In Java, `int`, `float` etc. are **primitive**.
But we can use **Wrapper Classes** like `Integer`, `Float` to treat them like objects.

```java
Integer a = 10;   // Wrapper for int
```

You can’t swap these in a method due to **pass-by-value** in Java.

---

## 🔷 Final Keyword

If you declare a reference with `final`, you **can’t assign it to a new object**, but you **can change its internal state**.

```java
final A obj = new A("Aniket");
obj.name = "Other name";  // OK
obj = new A("New");       // ❌ Not allowed
```

---

## 🔷 finalize() Method

This method runs **just before an object is destroyed** by the garbage collector.

Great! 👌
You’ve already covered some important theoretical points about **Java packages**. Now, let me simplify and organize all this into easy-to-understand notes with:

* ✅ **Theory in Simple English**
* 📁 **Real-World Analogy**
* 🧾 **Code Example**
* 🗂️ **Folder Structure**
* ⚙️ **How Java Finds Packages**
* 📌 **Important Points**

---

# 📦 Java Packages — Full Explanation in Simple English

---

## 🔷 What is a Package?

A **package** in Java is a **container (folder)** that holds related **classes, interfaces, and sub-packages**.

It helps:

* **Avoid name conflicts** between classes
* **Organize** code clearly
* **Control access/visibility**

> ✅ **Think of a package as a folder** that keeps your `.java` files neatly grouped.

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine your laptop has this folder:

```
Documents/
└── School/
    └── Student.java
    └── Teacher.java
```

In Java terms, `School` is a **package**, and the `.java` files are **classes** inside it.

---

## 🔹 Why Are Packages Useful?

| Reason                     | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Name conflict prevention | You can have your own `List` class without clashing with `java.util.List` |
| ✅ Organization             | Group similar files together (like utilities, models, services)           |
| ✅ Access control           | You can make classes/methods public, private, or protected                |

---

## 🔷 Creating a Package

### 📄 Step 1: Write a class with a package name at the top

```java
package MyPackage;  // Declare package at the top

public class MyClass {
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MyPackage!");
    }
}
```

📁 Save this file as:

```
MyPackage/MyClass.java
```

### ⚠️ Folder name must **match package name exactly** (case-sensitive!)

---

## 🔷 Importing a Package

You can **import** the class from another package like this:

```java
import MyPackage.MyClass;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.sayHello();
    }
}
```

---

## 🔷 Folder Structure (for above example)

```
.
├── Main.java
└── MyPackage/
    └── MyClass.java
```

---

## 🔧 Compiling and Running

### Step 1: Compile the package class

```bash
javac -d . MyPackage/MyClass.java
```

### Step 2: Compile the main class

```bash
javac Main.java
```

### Step 3: Run it

```bash
java Main
```

✅ Output:

```
Hello from MyPackage!
```

---

## 🔷 Package Hierarchy

### Example:

```java
package java.awt.image;
```

📁 Folder structure:

```
java/
└── awt/
    └── image/
        └── MyClass.java
```

So, Java package names must match the **folder structure exactly**.

---

## 🔷 How Java Finds Packages?

Java uses 3 ways to search for your custom packages:

### 1. **Current Directory (default)**

Java looks in the current folder and its subfolders.

### 2. **CLASSPATH Environment Variable**

You can set the `CLASSPATH` variable to point to your package folder.

Example:

```bash
set CLASSPATH=C:\Users\Aniket\JavaProjects
```

### 3. **-classpath Option (preferred)**

You can directly tell Java where to look during compile/run.

```bash
javac -classpath . Main.java
java -classpath . Main
```

---

## 🔒 Access Control with Packages

When you **import** a package, only the classes/methods marked as `public` will be visible outside.

| Access Modifier | Visibility                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| public          | Accessible everywhere                       |
| default         | Only within same package                    |
| private         | Only inside the same class                  |
| protected       | Same package + subclasses in other packages |

---

## 📌 Summary

| Topic                  | Explanation                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `package` keyword      | Declares the package a class belongs to                         |
| `import` keyword       | Used to include classes from other packages                     |
| Packages = folders     | Folder name must match the package name (case-sensitive)        |
| Java package hierarchy | Must reflect the folder structure (`package a.b.c;` → a/b/c/)   |
| Public access required | Only `public` classes/methods can be used from outside packages |
| Run using classpath    | Use `javac -d .` and `java -classpath .` to compile and run     |
