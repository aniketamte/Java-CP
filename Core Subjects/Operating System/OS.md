## 1. üí° Introduction to Operating Systems

An **Operating System (OS)** acts as an interface between the user and hardware. It manages system resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices) and allows the execution of programs efficiently.

### Responsibilities of an OS:

* Process Management
* Memory Management
* File System Management
* I/O System Management
* Security & Protection

### Real-World Analogy:

Think of the OS as the manager of a restaurant. Customers (users) place orders (programs), and the manager (OS) makes sure the kitchen (hardware) prepares them correctly while managing all staff (resources).

## 2. üß© Types of Operating Systems

| Type                    | Description                                             | Example                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Batch OS**            | Executes batches of jobs without user interaction.      | Payroll processing at end of day |
| **Multiprogramming OS** | Runs multiple programs by efficiently using CPU time.   | UNIX                             |
| **Multitasking OS**     | Allows multiple tasks for a single user simultaneously. | Windows 10                       |
| **Time-Sharing OS**     | Each user gets a time slice.                            | Mainframes                       |
| **Real-Time OS**        | Executes tasks within strict timing constraints.        | Airbag system in cars            |

## 3. üîÅ Processes and Threads

### üß† Process

A **process** is a running instance of a program. Each process has:

* Program Counter (PC)
* Registers
* Stack
* Heap
* Process Control Block (PCB)

### üßµ Thread

A **thread** is a lightweight unit of a process.

#### Thread vs Process:

| Aspect        | Process                     | Thread                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Overhead      | High                        | Low                    |
| Memory        | Separate                    | Shared                 |
| Communication | Inter-Process Communication | Easier (shared memory) |

### Example:

In a web browser:

* One thread handles UI
* Another loads images
* Another fetches data

| Algorithm       | Description                     | Example                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **FCFS**        | First Come First Serve          | Long queue in a bank                    |
| **SJF**         | Shortest Job First              | Print smallest documents first          |
| **SRTF**        | Preemptive SJF                  | Interrupts current job for shorter ones |
| **Round Robin** | Fixed time slice (quantum)      | Windows multitasking                    |
| **Priority**    | High-priority tasks first       | Emergency task in OS                    |
| **HRRN**        | Based on response ratio         | Fair scheduling in printers             |
| **MLQ**         | Multi-level queues, no movement | Interactive vs background               |
| **MLFQ**        | Dynamic queue switching         | Modern OS schedulers like Linux CFS     |

## 5. üîê Critical Section and Synchronization

### üí≠ Problem

When multiple processes access shared data, **race conditions** can occur.

### ‚úÖ Solution Requirements:

* **Mutual Exclusion**: One process in critical section
* **Progress**: No unnecessary delay
* **Bounded Waiting**: Limited wait time

### Tools:

* **Semaphore**
* **Mutex**
* **Spinlock**

### Example:

Two people editing a Google Doc at once. Without locking, changes can conflict.

---

## 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Deadlocks

### 4 Necessary Conditions:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**
2. **Hold and Wait**
3. **No Preemption**
4. **Circular Wait**

### üí° Strategies:

* **Prevention**: Break one condition (e.g., no hold and wait)
* **Avoidance**: Use **Banker's Algorithm**
* **Detection & Recovery**: Periodic check + kill/restart
* **Ignore**: Reboot when needed (used in Windows/UNIX)

### Example:

Four trains are waiting on a circular track for each other to move = Circular wait = Deadlock.

## 7. üß† Memory Management

### Key Concepts:

* **Overlaying**: Load only required parts into memory.
* **Swapping**: Temporarily move processes out of memory.

### Partition Allocation:

| Scheme       | Description                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Fixed**    | Fixed size memory blocks     |
| **Variable** | Dynamically sized partitions |

### Fit Techniques:

* **First Fit**: First block large enough
* **Best Fit**: Smallest block that fits
* **Worst Fit**: Largest available block

---

## 8. üíæ Virtual Memory

Enables execution of programs larger than physical memory.

* **Paging**: Fixed-size blocks
* **Segmentation**: Logical division
* **Demand Paging**: Load pages on demand

### Page Fault:

Occurs when a program accesses a page not in RAM. OS brings it in from disk.

---

## 9. üìÑ Page Replacement Algorithms

| Algorithm   | Description                             | Example            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **FIFO**    | Remove oldest page                      | Queue-style        |
| **Optimal** | Remove page not needed for longest time | Theoretical        |
| **LRU**     | Remove least recently used              | Browser tab memory |

### üîç Belady‚Äôs Anomaly:

In **FIFO**, more frames can result in more page faults!

## 10. üíΩ Disk Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description                          | Analogy                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **FCFS**  | Serve requests in order              | Queue at a shop        |
| **SSTF**  | Shortest seek time first             | Go to nearest request  |
| **SCAN**  | Elevator algorithm                   | Moves to end, reverses |
| **CSCAN** | Circular SCAN                        | Jumps to start         |
| **LOOK**  | Like SCAN, but stops at last request |                        |
| **CLOOK** | Like CSCAN, but stops early          |                        |

## 11. üìö Miscellaneous Key Terms

* **Virtual Memory**: Execute apps larger than RAM.
* **Demand Paging**: Load pages on demand.
* **Thrashing**: Excessive paging = no real work.
* **RAID**: Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks.
* **Reentrancy**: Code that can be safely shared.
* **Starvation**: A process waits forever.
* **Aging**: Gradually increase priority to avoid starvation.
* **Spooling**: Print queue management.

2. Better resource utilization
3. Lower overhead than multiprocessing
