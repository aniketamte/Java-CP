### 📘 Java-CP (Competitive Programming in Java)

---

# 👋 Welcome...!  

Hello, fellow developer! ✨  
This repository is a **comprehensive collection of Competitive Programming (CP) solutions** implemented in **Java**.  
The primary goal of this project is to provide **well-structured, beginner-friendly, and interview-focused** solutions to popular problems across multiple domains such as **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Core Subjects**.  

🚀 *Happy learning and coding!*  

---

# 📌 Overview  

This repository is designed to help **students**, **aspiring developers**, and **competitive programmers** build a **solid foundation** in:

- ✅ **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
- ✅ **Core Computer Science Concepts**  
- ✅ **Problem-Solving Techniques**  
- ✅ **Interview Preparation**  

Each folder represents a different **topic** or **category** in CP/DSA, with **Java-based implementations** and clear problem-solving approaches.

# 📚 Topics Covered  

The repository includes solutions for a wide variety of concepts:  

- 📂 **ArrayList** → Practice problems on dynamic arrays  
- 📂 **Arrays** → Classic array problems and LeetCode solutions  
- 📂 **Backtracking** → Recursive solutions to problems like *Sudoku, N-Queens, Rat in a Maze*  
- 📂 **Binary Search / BST / Binary Tree** → Searching, traversal, and advanced tree problems  
- 📂 **CoreSubjects** → SQL, DBMS, OS, and CS fundamentals  
- 📂 **Dynamic Programming (DP)** → Tabulation, memoization, and optimized DP problems  
- 📂 **Graph** → BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, and graph theory problems  
- 📂 **Greedy Algorithms** → Interval scheduling, Huffman coding, and more  
- 📂 **LinkedList / Stack / Queue** → Implementations and interview practice problems  
- 📂 **Recursion** → Foundation to advanced recursive problems  
- 📂 **Sliding Window** → Subarray and substring pattern problems  
- 📂 **Heap / Priority Queue** → Top-K elements, heap sort, scheduling problems  
- 📂 **Strings** → String manipulation, pattern matching, and regex-based problems  
- 📂 **Knapsack & DP Variants** → 0/1 Knapsack, Unbounded Knapsack, and related patterns  

... and many more 🚀
