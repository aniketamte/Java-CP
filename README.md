# Solving DSA Questions: My Daily Progress

# Hello, GitHub Visitors! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find my daily progress as I solve Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems using Java. Whether you're a fellow learner or just curious about my coding journey, feel free to explore, learn, and contribute.

# Overview

This repository is dedicated to my journey of solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from popular platforms like GeeksforGeeks (GFG), LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef using Java. It serves as a tracker for my progress, a collection of solutions, and a source of learning for others who wish to improve their problem-solving skills.

# Platforms Covered

1. GeeksforGeeks (GFG)

A vast repository of DSA problems covering basics to advanced topics.

Focus on problems tagged with specific data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming topics.

2. LeetCode

Covers problems categorized by difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

Focus on real-world interview problems and systematic learning.

3. Codeforces

Competitive programming contests and problemsets.

Focus on improving speed and accuracy in solving problems under time constraints.

4. CodeChef

Long challenges, Cook-offs, and LunchTime contests.

Focus on mastering diverse problem categories and competitive programming strategies.

Goals and Strategies

# Goals

Solve at least 5 DSA problems daily.

Alternate between platforms for diversity.

Participate in contests regularly to build competitive programming skills.

# Strategies

Start with easy problems and gradually move to medium and hard.

Focus on learning new concepts rather than just solving problems.

Revise previously solved problems to strengthen understanding.

Use Javaâ€™s built-in libraries and utilities efficiently to optimize solutions.
